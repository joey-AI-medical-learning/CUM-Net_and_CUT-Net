# Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation based on Hidden Feature Discrepancy between Different Learning Paradigms
A novel semi-supervised Medical image segmentation method
### News
```
We provided our pre-trained models on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets, see './CUM-Net_and_CUT-Net/Checkpoint/';
```
```
We released the codes;
```

### Requirements
This repository is based on PyTorch 1.13.0, CUDA 11.7 and Python 3.8; All experiments in our paper were conducted on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

### Usage
1. Clone the repo.;
```
git clone https://github.com/joey-AI-medical-learning/CUM-Net_and_CUT-Net.git
```
2. Put the data in './CUM-Net_and_CUT-Net/input';

3. Train the model;

4. Test the model;
